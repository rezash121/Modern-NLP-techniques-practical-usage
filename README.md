# Kaggle + Hugging Face Integration for Sentiment Analysis

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Kaggle with Hugging Face to build a sentiment analysis pipeline. The project covers:

- **Loading and Preprocessing a Kaggle Dataset:** Using the Sentiment140 dataset for sentiment analysis.
- **Training a Transformer Model:** Training a small Hugging Face Transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT) on Kaggle.
- **Saving the Model and Tokenizer:** Persisting the trained model and tokenizer.
- **Evaluating the Model on Google Colab:** Loading and evaluating the saved model in Google Colab.
- **(Optional) Visualizing Attention:** Visualizing attention weights of the model for deeper insights.

## Overview

This project shows how to:
1. Log in to Kaggle, load, and preprocess a sentiment analysis dataset (Sentiment140).
2. Train a small Transformer model (DistilBERT) using Hugging Face’s Transformers library.
3. Save the trained model and tokenizer.
4. Evaluate the model on Google Colab.
5. (Optional) Visualize the model’s attention to understand its focus.

## Prerequisites

- **Kaggle Account:** To access and train on the Sentiment140 dataset.
- **Google Colab Account:** For model evaluation.
- **Python 3.7+** and relevant libraries: `transformers`, `datasets`, `scikit-learn`, `torch`, `bertviz` (for attention visualization), etc.
- **Kaggle API Token:** (if needed) for dataset access.

## Training on Kaggle

### Dataset

We use the [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset, which contains tweets labeled as positive or negative.

### Environment Setup

- Open a new Kaggle Notebook.
- Attach the Sentiment140 dataset to your notebook.
- (Optional) Upgrade libraries by running:
  ```python
  !pip install --upgrade transformers datasets scikit-learn
Training Instructions
Load and Preprocess the Data:
The notebook loads the CSV file with proper quoting to handle commas in text fields, cleans the data, maps labels (0 for negative, 1 for positive), and splits the data into training and validation sets.

Tokenize the Data:
Use DistilBertTokenizer to convert text to token IDs, padding/truncating to a fixed length (e.g., 128 tokens).

Create a PyTorch Dataset:
A custom dataset class wraps the tokenized data for use with the Hugging Face Trainer.

Train the Model:
The model (DistilBertForSequenceClassification) is trained using Hugging Face’s Trainer with evaluation and save strategies set to 'epoch'. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

Save the Model and Tokenizer:
After training, the model and tokenizer are saved to a folder (e.g., ./trained_model) and then compressed into a ZIP file (trained_model.zip) for download.

Saving the Model
After training, download trained_model.zip from the Kaggle Notebook's Output section.

Evaluation on Google Colab
Uploading the Model
Open a new Google Colab Notebook.
Click on the Files icon (left sidebar) and upload trained_model.zip.
Running Evaluation
Install Required Libraries:

python
Copy
!pip install transformers bertviz
Extract and Load the Model:

python
Copy
import zipfile
with zipfile.ZipFile('trained_model.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall('./trained_model')

from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertForSequenceClassification
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./trained_model')
model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./trained_model')
model.eval()
Evaluate on Sample Sentences:

python
Copy
sample_sentences = [
    "I hate this movie, it was terrible!",
    "Absolutely fantastic experience, would recommend!",
    "It was okay, not the best but not the worst.",
    "I didn't like the plot, but the acting was great."
]

inputs = tokenizer(sample_sentences, return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)
predictions = torch.argmax(outputs.logits, dim=1).tolist()

label_map = {0: 'Negative', 1: 'Positive'}
for sentence, pred in zip(sample_sentences, predictions):
    print(f"Sentence: {sentence}\nPredicted Sentiment: {label_map[pred]}\n")
Attention Visualization (Optional)
To visualize attention weights:

python
Copy
from bertviz import head_view

# Choose a sentence to visualize
sentence_to_visualize = "I absolutely loved the new superhero movie!"
inputs_vis = tokenizer(sentence_to_visualize, return_tensors='pt')
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs_vis = model(**inputs_vis)
attentions = outputs_vis.attentions
tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs_vis['input_ids'][0])
head_view(attentions, tokens)
